# Article to Avatar Video

English | [中文](README.md)

> Do not merely read an article aloud. Direct it into a video.

A Codex Skill that turns Chinese long-form content into a visually directed, release-gated video project across human enhancement, faceless visual, and authorized avatar modes.

Current version: `v0.1.0`

## Why it exists

Most avatar tools start with a finished script and return a talking-head clip. `article-to-avatar-video` starts with the article. It decides what to say, how to say it, which claims need visual evidence, and when the presenter should move aside for the information.

It is not another talking-head generator. It is an editorial video production pipeline.

## How it differs from digital-human talking-head skills

This project is not centered on "generate one avatar clip." It is centered on "direct one Chinese long-form article into a publishable video."

| Dimension | Digital-human talking-head skill | Article to Avatar Video |
|---|---|---|
| Starting point | Finished script, portrait, and voice source | Chinese article, WeChat post, or Markdown document |
| Core problem | Safely coordinate voice/avatar providers | Adapt, storyboard, visualize, and release-gate article content |
| Screen strategy | Presenter-led talking head | Information graphics, evidence, process, comparison, and presenter PIP |
| Success criterion | Authorized avatar video generation | Source fidelity, visual information density, controlled cost, publish-ready QA |
| Contribution focus | Provider API, asset preflight, job state | Spoken adaptation, semantic scene grammar, layout presets, platform QA |

If you already have a finished script and only need an authorized talking-head clip, this is not the shortest path.
If you have articles, course scripts, or knowledge-base content that need visual structure, this is the intended scope.

Maintainers can use [docs/positioning-vs-talking-head-skills.md](docs/positioning-vs-talking-head-skills.md) to keep public communication centered on the article-native video pipeline, not a provider pairing or talking-head clone.

## What makes it different

- **Article-native**: preserve the source, separate sourced claims from transitions, and adapt prose instead of reading paragraphs verbatim.
- **Semantic visual direction**: choose comparison, process, hierarchy, number, evidence, quote, and diagram scenes from meaning.
- **Presenter-aware composition**: use the avatar as a presenter, picture-in-picture guide, or omit it when evidence needs the full canvas.
- **Provider-adaptable**: coordinate HeyGen, ElevenLabs, MiniMax, local CosyVoice, or future adapters through portable contracts.
- **Cost and consent gates**: support `off`, `confirm`, and `auto` paid-call policies, cost ceilings, previews, and resumable job state.
- **Release-gated output**: verify media properties, consent, and visual review before setting `publish_ready` to `true`.

## Current scope

This is a **Codex orchestration Skill**, not a hosted service or a bundled provider SDK. It provides production rules, portable data contracts, deterministic helper scripts, a local CosyVoice guide, a privacy-safe example, tests, and CI.

Voice, avatar, and rendering operations are performed by provider adapters and HyperFrames tools available in the user's Codex environment. Users bring their own accounts, credentials, billing, and rights to source materials.

## Three production modes

| Mode | `presenter_mode` | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Human enhancement | `human` | Keep a real performance and add captions, graphics, and effects |
| Faceless visual | `none` | Use narration, typography, diagrams, screenshots, and licensed media |
| Avatar presenter | `avatar` | Use an authorized generated avatar or disclosed performance-driven lip sync |

All modes share the content, scene, effect, cover, QA, and export pipeline. See [docs/production-modes.md](docs/production-modes.md).

The project remains useful without paid MiniMax or HeyGen calls. See [docs/local-runtime.md](docs/local-runtime.md) for automatic hardware routing and mock fallback.

## Open core boundary

This repository open-sources how an Agent turns an article into a checkable video project. It does not open-source the full commercial workbench.

The open layer includes the Skill, project contracts, examples, validation scripts, and release gates. A paid layer can still include the Obsidian workbench, historical project management, cover generation, Jianying/CapCut import packages, template packs, course project files, and custom implementation.

See:

- [Kanvis Cut Suite Direction](docs/kanvis-cut-suite.md)
- [Open Core Boundary](docs/open-core-boundary.md)
- [Obsidian Workbench Pro](docs/obsidian-workbench-pro.md)
- [Jianying / CapCut Export Strategy](docs/jianying-capcut-export.md)

## Requirements

- Codex or a compatible Skill runtime
- Node.js 20+
- `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` for media QA
- HyperFrames when rendering a finished composition
- Provider accounts and API keys only when using cloud generation

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kanvis-chen/article-to-avatar-video ~/.codex/skills/article-to-avatar-video
```

Start a new Codex task and invoke the Skill explicitly:

```text
Use $article-to-avatar-video to turn this Chinese article into a visually directed avatar video.
Show me the script, scene plan, provider cost, and preview before paid full-length generation.
```

Implicit invocation is disabled to prevent accidental paid avatar generation.

## Try the privacy-safe example

```bash
npm test
npm run check
```

Manual workflow:

```bash
node scripts/preflight.mjs \
  --article examples/knowledge-video/article.md \
  --config examples/knowledge-video/kanvis-cut.config.json

node scripts/detect-runtime.mjs \
  --config examples/knowledge-video/kanvis-cut.config.json

node scripts/init-project.mjs \
  --article examples/knowledge-video/article.md \
  --config examples/knowledge-video/kanvis-cut.config.json \
  --out ./demo-project

node scripts/validate-scene-plan.mjs examples/knowledge-video/scene-plan.json
```

Use `--paid` with `preflight.mjs` to require confirmed consent, configured asset IDs, and an enabled paid-call policy.

The repository also includes a more general cut-project protocol example:

- [assets/kanvis-cut-project.schema.json](assets/kanvis-cut-project.schema.json)
- [examples/knowledge-video/kanvis-cut-project.json](examples/knowledge-video/kanvis-cut-project.json)

## Release QA

```bash
node scripts/quality-check.mjs \
  --video output/video.mp4 \
  --config kanvis-cut.config.json \
  --report output/quality-report.json \
  --visual-review passed
```

`publish_ready` becomes `true` only when automated blockers are empty and the visual review has passed.

## Safety

- Use only authorized articles, voices, portraits, brands, and publishing accounts.
- Load secrets from environment variables. Never commit them or print full authorization headers.
- Do not publish real voice samples, private portraits, client videos, signed URLs, or local private paths.
- Generate a 10-15 second preview before full generation with a new voice, avatar, or provider.
- Verify medical, legal, financial, political, and rapidly changing claims.
- Follow platform disclosure rules for synthetic media.
